        "\n",
        "•\tAmbitious Growth Plans: While growth is positive, the aggressive expansion, especially for Contigo A (25% monthly), can strain resources and potentially lead to a higher influx of riskier borrowers, further exacerbating the DQ issue, Increasing credit risk.\n",

        "•\tCompetitive Market for Contigo B: The slower growth of Contigo B (10%\n",

        "\n",
        "•\tOperational Costs: Although scalable, the 30 pesos per account operational cost can become substantial as the customer base grows rapidly, especially with a high proportion of Contigo A customers.\n",
